# Pacman
A Test in a Pacman's horizontal movement.

#Operation:
The pacman.png is designed to move from the left to the right and reverse direction at the window borders. It currently moves left to right properly but it is not keeping the image outside the first frame.

#Roadmap:
My goal is to fix my code so the Pacman.png is not only active for the first frame. I am sure it's a rather simple fix but I am very new at coding and this was a very early project.
