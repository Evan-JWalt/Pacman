# Pacman
A Test in a Pacman's horizontal movement.

#Operation:
The pacman.png is designed to move from the left to the right and reverse direction at the window borders. It currently moves left to right properly but it is not keeping the image outside the first frame.

#Roadmap:
A cool addition to this code that I could make is to make the pacmen speed up or change direction when clicking on them individually. Another alteration could be made to randomly change color as they bounce off the window borders
